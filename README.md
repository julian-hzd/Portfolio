# Portfolio

This project was created with the intention to share my professional work with others. It talks briefly about its creator me, and the projects I have worked on over the last 3 years. As well, as the programming languages, I am the most familiarized with. It also serves as a quick link to my social networks, such as LinkdIn, GitHub and mail. It was created using react, bootstrap and css.
